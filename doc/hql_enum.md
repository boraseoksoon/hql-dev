Okay, let's finalize the design document for simple enums based on **Option A (Core Compiler Implementation)** using the Lisp-style syntax, and then I'll explain the specific role of the Syntax Transformer in HQL based on the provided files.

# HQL Enumerations (Core Design with Lisp Syntax)

This document outlines the design for basic, type-safe enumerations in HQL, using a Lisp-style syntax implemented as a core compiler feature for optimal tooling support (LSP, autocompletion).

## 1. Goal

To define a clear, Lisp-native syntax for simple enumerations (groups of named constants like `macOS` under a type like `OsType`). This improves code clarity and provides runtime type safety. The design enables intuitive dot-notation access (`OsType.macOS`) and potential shorthand access (`.macOS`), supported by IDE autocompletion.

## 2. Implementation Approach (Core Compiler Feature)

This design adopts the approach of implementing `(enum ...)` as a **core language feature**.

* **Mechanism:** The HQL compiler (parser, AST/IR stages, code generator) is modified to directly recognize and understand the `(enum ...)` S-expression syntax. Specific internal representations (e.g., `EnumDefinitionNode`, `EnumCaseNode` in the AST/IR) are created.
* **Rationale:** This provides the most explicit and analyzable structure for Language Server Protocols (LSPs) and other tools, leading to reliable autocompletion, type hinting, and potential future static analysis. It treats enums as a fundamental part of the language.
* **Alternatives Not Chosen:** Implementing via the Syntax Transformer stage or solely via Macros would obscure the enum's semantic meaning earlier in the pipeline, making robust tooling integration significantly more challenging.

## 3. Declaration Syntax

The definition uses an `(enum ...)` S-expression form, recognized by the compiler.

```hql
;; Define a simple enumeration
(enum OsType
  (case macOS)
  (case windowOS)
  (case linux)
)

;; Define an enum with specified Raw Values (e.g., Int)
(enum StatusCodes: Int   ; Raw Type declared after Enum Name
  (case ok 200)
  (case notFound 404)
)

;; Define an enum with Associated Values (using named parameters)
(enum Barcode
  (case upc system: Int manufacturer: Int product: Int check: Int)
  (case qrCode value: String)
)

```

* **S-expression Validity:** This syntax is a pure S-expression (lists, symbols, literals). The basic parser can read it.
* **Compiler Understanding:** The compiler's later stages (beyond basic parsing) are modified to recognize `(enum ...)` and understand its meaning â€“ defining a distinct enum type with cases.

## 4. Usage Examples

Access involves dot notation; shorthand may be possible with type inference.

```hql
;; Assign simple case
(let currentOS OsType.macOS)

;; Compare simple case
(if (= currentOS OsType.linux) (print "Linux!"))

;; Use raw value enum
(let status StatusCodes.notFound)
; (status.rawValue) ; Hypothetical access to raw value => 404

;; Create associated value case
(let code (Barcode.qrCode value: "hql-data"))

;; Use shorthand with type hints
(fx processStatus (code: StatusCodes) (print code))
(processStatus code: .ok) ; .ok resolves to StatusCodes.ok
```

## 5. Dot Notation & Autocompletion Roles

Reliable tooling stems from the core implementation:

**Role of the HQL Language / Compiler:**

1.  **Recognize Structure:** Parse `(enum TypeName ...)` into specific AST/IR nodes.
2.  **Define Dot Semantics:** Define `TypeName.caseName` as type-aware access to a specific enum case, resolving it internally.
3.  **Define Shorthand Semantics (Optional):** Allow `.caseName` where the enum type is contextually clear (e.g., via type hints), resolving it to the full case.
4.  **Expose Structure:** Provide the structured AST/IR for LSP analysis.

**Role of the LSP / IDE Tooling:**

1.  **Analyze Structure:** Read the dedicated enum nodes from the compiler's AST/IR.
2.  **Suggest on `TypeName.`:** Look up the `TypeName` enum definition and suggest its defined cases.
3.  **Suggest on `.` (Shorthand):** Use context (type hints) to find the expected enum type and suggest its cases.

## 6. Summary

Using `(enum TypeName (case caseName) ...)` syntax implemented as a **core compiler feature** provides a flexible, Lisp-native way to define enums. This approach creates an explicit internal structure (AST/IR) that LSPs can reliably analyze, enabling robust dot-notation autocompletion (`TypeName.` and `.caseName`) crucial for developer productivity.
