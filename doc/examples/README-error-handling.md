# HQL Error Handling Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to the HQL error reporting system to provide more accurate and helpful error messages, particularly for syntax errors like unclosed parentheses.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed hardcoded filenames in source mapping**
   - The source map generator was using a hardcoded filename (`input.hql`) instead of the actual file being processed
   - This caused errors to be reported with incorrect file paths
   - Solution: Ensured all file paths are properly passed through the pipeline

2. **Enhanced parser validation**
   - Implemented robust validation of bracket balance during parsing
   - Added detailed context information for unclosed parentheses
   - Improved detection of mismatched brackets with precise position information

3. **Early syntax error detection**
   - Added a pre-check for balanced parentheses during file loading
   - This catches syntax errors before the full transpilation process
   - Provides immediate feedback to users about basic syntax issues

4. **Improved error visualization**
   - Enhanced error messages with surrounding code context
   - Added visual indicators pointing to the exact location of errors
   - Included clear explanations of what might be wrong

## Example Error Messages

Before the improvements, a missing closing parenthesis might be reported as:

```
Error: i is not defined at line 2:6
```

After the improvements, the same error would be reported as:

```
Parse Error: Unclosed '(' at line 15. Missing closing delimiter.
Context:
  ;; Some code before
â†’ (let x 10
  ;; Code after

at line 15, column 2
```

## Test Cases

The `test-errors.hql` file contains various error scenarios to test the improved error reporting:

1. Unclosed parenthesis
2. Mismatched brackets
3. Extra closing parenthesis
4. Nested unclosed parenthesis
5. Multiple nested errors

## Implementation Details

The improvements were made in the following files:

1. `core/src/transpiler/pipeline/parser.ts`: Enhanced token validation and error reporting
2. `core/src/transpiler/pipeline/ts-ast-to-ts-code.ts`: Fixed hardcoded filename in source map generation
3. `core/src/transformer.ts`: Ensured correct source file paths are used
4. `core/src/transpiler/hql-transpiler.ts`: Improved error display and prioritized syntax errors
5. `core/src/bundler.ts`: Added early syntax checking before transpilation

These changes significantly improve the developer experience by making errors easier to understand and fix.
